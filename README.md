# Getting Started with Hike Chat Backup Viewer

Since, Hike took the backend down in Feb 2021, a lot of users want to view their chat history (which hike mailed to them), in a more readable format.

Here's a tool to help you do that.

Steps:

1. Save the Hike folder inside the public folder of your copy of this project.
2. Run the following command: `npm install`
3. Run the following command: `npm start`
4. Open the browser and go to http://localhost:3000/
5. Upload your chat history stored in .txt format.
6. Enjoy reading your old conversation!
